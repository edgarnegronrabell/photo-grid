An image gallery done as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. 
At the time of this writing, I am aware that this is perhaps not the best way of
coding an image gallery. I would naturally use CSS Grid, but, for the sake of
following along with this course, I am doing it things Steele's way. 

Coding along with the tutorial I decided to take some liberties and add some features
of my own. One thing I decided to do was make a mobile view for the image gallery.
The right way, btw. Not by using floats.
